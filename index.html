                <h2>About Pastor Koshy Samuel</h2> 
                <p> It was a crisp Sunday morning in Limerick, and the Gilgal Pentecostal Church hummed with life. </p>
                <p>Families walked in, the scent of fresh rain mingling with the warm, inviting aroma of coffee</p> 
                <p>in the fellowship hall. At the center of it all stood Pastor Koshy Samuel, his presence gentle yet commanding, like a lighthouse guiding the faithful to safety. </p> 
                <p> Born and raised in Kerala, India, Pastor Koshy had been no stranger to challenges. His calling came early in life, during a prayer meeting in a small village church where he felt an undeniable pull toward ministry. The journey led him across continents, finally planting him in Limerick, a place that seemed worlds apart from the tropical landscapes of his youth. </p>
                <p> Yet, Limerick felt like home. </p>
                <p> Under Pastor Koshy’s leadership, Gilgal Pentecostal Church grew not just in numbers but in spirit. Known for his humility and wisdom, Pastor Koshy had a gift for weaving scripture into everyday life. His sermons weren’t just words but lessons that stayed with the congregation long after they left the pews. Whether it was a story from his own life or a parable from the Bible, he had a way of making the message feel personal, as though it was meant just for you. </p> 
                <p> One chilly winter evening, as the city prepared for Christmas, a struggling family knocked on the church doors. They had come to Limerick seeking a better life but found themselves without food or a place to stay. It was Pastor Koshy who answered their call. He welcomed them in, shared a warm meal, and found them shelter through the church network. His actions spoke louder than any sermon. </p>
                <p> “We are the hands and feet of Christ,” he often said. “Our faith is meaningless if it does not move us to love.” </p> <p> But it wasn’t just grand gestures that defined him. It was the small things: remembering the names of every child in Sunday School, visiting the sick, or simply offering a kind word to a weary soul after service. </p> <p> Gilgal Pentecostal Church was more than a congregation; it was a family, bound together by faith and love, with Pastor Koshy as its ever-steady shepherd. </p>
